# Goal
The goal of this project, which is a task from the Odin Project, was to create a rendition of the classic Battleship boardgame through the use of Test Driven Development. Besides making the game,the aim was to also use Jest, a Javascript Testing Framework, to help me create the code for this game.

# Features
- Classic Battleship fun!
- Play with another human or the AI. 
- AI can place ships on the board as well as attack intelligently. 

# Tools and Technologies
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- Github and Git
- ES Lint
- Linux Command Line
- Chrome Dev Tools
- Jest
- ChatGPT

# Things I've Learned and Noticed
- Learned that writing tests improves code quality and proper planning 
- Learned how to use Jest
- Realized that I tend to get impatient and make patchy fixes when I am almost finished with a project.
- Finally used the extend keyward to create a subclass for the first time for the purpose of avoiding bloating in an already densely packed class.
