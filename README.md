# Goal
The goal of this project was to create a rendition of the classic Battleship boardgame through the use of Test Driven Development. The game was to be made not only by typical tech needed to make this game but also with the assistance of Jest, a Javascript Testing Framework, to ensure that code is constantly tested before being used. 

# Features
- Battleship fun!
- Play with another human or the AI. 
- AI can place ships on the board as well as attack intelligently.

# Tools and Technologies
Visual Studio Code
HTML
Javascript
CSS
Github and Git
ES Lint
Linux Command Line
Chrome Dev Tools
Jest
ChatGPT

# Things I've Learned and Noticed
Writing tests improves code quality and proper planning 
Learned how to use Jest
Tend to get impatient and make patchy fixes when I am almost finished with a project.
Finally used extend to create a subclass for the first time for the purpose of avoiding bloating an already densely packed class.
