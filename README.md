# Goal
The goal of this project is to create program that using asyncronous programming and an API. This app was made for the purpose of the Odin Project but instead of making a weather app, I wanted to make use of dictionary-like api, thus why I made a hangman game that pulls random words from an api called Random Word API created from API Ninjas (https://api-ninjas.com/).

# Features
Get a random word using an API Guess the word using either the input or letter buttons Renders a stick figure body

# Tools and Technologies
Visual Studio Code
HTML
Javascript
CSS
Github and Git
Web Pack
ES Lint
Linux Command Line
Chrome Dev Tools
Random Word API
Web Animation API
Canvas API

# Things I've Learned and Noticed
Learned how to make asycronous code using promises, await and async.
Learned how to use an API from another server.
Learned how to use the Web Animation and Canvas API
Need to document my code.
Need to commit more often and madk better comments on my commits.
I have the tendency to rush into writing code right away and also not taking my time to read documentation slowly. Basically, need to slow down.
This app will sometimes not work due to CORS policy. Need to learn more about this (and take my time to read the documents about it) and update this later.
